## About Google Stitch
Stitch is an AI-powered tool by Google designed to accelerate the UI/UX design and development process. It helps users transform ideas, sketches, images, or text prompts into user interface designs and frontend code (HTML/CSS).

## Key Features
- **AI-Powered Design Generation:** Uses generative AI (including Gemini models) to create UI mockups and prototypes from natural language prompts or visual inputs.
- **Code Generation:** Outputs production-ready HTML and CSS code for the generated designs.
- **Iterative Design:** Supports a conversational interface, allowing users to refine and modify designs through dialogue.
- **Customization:** Offers options to customize themes, color palettes, typography, and layout components.
- **Figma Integration:** Allows exporting designs to Figma for further detailed work.
- **Versatile Input:** Accepts text prompts, image uploads, sketches, and wireframes as input.

## Target Audience
Stitch is designed for a wide range of users, including:
- Product Managers
- UX/UI Designers
- Frontend Developers

## How Stitch Works
1. **Input:** User provides a text prompt (e.g., "a settings page for a music app") or an image/sketch.
2. **Generation:** Stitch's AI model processes the input and generates initial UI designs and code.
3. **Iteration:** User reviews the design and can request changes or provide feedback conversationally.
4. **Customization:** User applies styling options and customizes components.
5. **Export:** User exports the final design to Figma or as HTML/CSS code.
